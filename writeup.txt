P! Gold Creation: Portal Gun
	The player may teleport to another location in which there are two guns, one that shoots a blue portal, and one that shoots an orange portal.
	The player may then teleport from the blue portal location to the orange portal location and vice versa.
	The player may move the portal locations at anytime by shooting the guns at either a wall or a floor, etc.
	There exists another button in the portal gun location to teleport back to the main building when they want to.
